# Client-Server-project
This C++ based application implements a client-server architecture for encrypting and decrypting text using a Caesar cipher. The server supports multiple parallel client connections using threads. The client sends requests to the server to either encrypt or decrypt text. The server processes the request and returns the result to the client.
